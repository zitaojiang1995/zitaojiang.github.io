The main objective of this study is to investigate the airflow patterns in single-sided ventilation of isolated buildings in which the ventilation rate can not be easily predicted by the conventional Orifice equation. The research focuses on buildings with two openings located either at the front or back external wall, with building aspect ratios of 1:1 and 1:2.The study utilizes Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with the particle tracking technique validated by velocity data obtained from a wind tunnel experiment. Ventilation performance is evaluated by Airflow Rate (AFR) and Purging Flow Rate (PFR). AFR was obtained based on the instantaneous velocity over the openings, and PFR was determined by the tracer gas method. The results show that the influence of pulsation flow and eddy penetration both exist in single-sided ventilation. The comparison of AFR and PFR indicates part of the airflow through the opening does not contribute to effectively removing the indoor contaminants, which is quantitively evaluated by ventilation efficiency defined as the ratio of PFR and AFR. In order to explicitly observe and depict the airflow, the massless particles were emitted at the opening, and the trajectories were analysed. The Probability Density Function (PDF) of indoor residence and indoor travel distance was calculated. The high probability of short indoor travel distance and the residence time, which is mainly caused by the eddy at the openings and time-variant pulsation flow, can explain the difference between AFR and PFR.
