There is a growing body of literature that recognizes that natural ventilation plays a vital role in indoor air quality, thermal comfort and building energy consumption. This paper systematically reviews the previously published research of the most efficient and typical natural ventilation type - cross ventilation, aiming to present the main research topics in contemporary research and provide an agenda for future studies. The methodologies, airflow pattern, ventilation models and influencing parameters of cross ventilation were comprehensively summarized and discussed. The chained analysis and data-driven methods are the potential approaches to study cross ventilation more efficiently. The comparisons of different ventilation models of cross ventilation help to better understand the basic mechanisms that drive the cross ventilation airflow.
