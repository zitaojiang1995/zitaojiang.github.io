Hej, this is Zitao Jiang. I am a PhD student at [Built Environment Laboratory](http://www.arch.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp/~labo4/index-j.html). [Osaka Univeristy](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en) supervised by [Tomohiro Kobayashi](https://rd.iai.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/a0d52d227d6f65e8.html). My current study focuses on the airflow of natural ventilation which includes wind-induced and thermal-induced ventilation. The opitimal utilizaion of natural ventilation has a large potential to reduce the energy consumption caused by HVAC system. In the previous research, steady airflow of natural ventilation was widely studied. However, due to the time-variant outdoor wind environment, the fluctuating characteristics of natural ventilation also play a significant role in natural ventilation. In my study, I use [Wind tunnel experiment](http://www.juf.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp/wt/index.html) and LES (Large Eddy Simulation) to study the unsteady airflow in natural ventilation. 


Research Interests
======
My research interest ranges from indoor ventilation to urban scale wind environment and urban ventilation.
